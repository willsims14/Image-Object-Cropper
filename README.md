# PNG Image Object Cropper


## About
This script was built to crop PNG images based on the objects within the image. It works well for logos and emblems. Users can change the DPI that is used to calculate the image size in Inches.

## Built With
* The [SciKit Image](http://scikit-image.org/) package was used to load, manipulate, and make calculations on images.
* I used the [ndarray](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) from the [NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) package as a data structure for the images.
* I used [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to handle the visualization side of the script.
